           <p class="chh">Dark chocolate has become associated with quality and tends to be celebrated by the fine <br>cacao and chocolate industry. But it’s not as simple as darker meaning better.James Walter, the founder of Seed <br>Chocolate, explains that “dark chocolate is essentially made from cocoa beans and sugar in varying amounts.” 
           	<br>Colin Hartman at Harper Macaw says that dark chocolate is “just cocoa beans and sugar with the addition of a <br>percentage of cocoa butter.”Some manufacturers add more cacao butter to dark chocolate for improved texture. <br>“It helps to give greater viscosity to the chocolate when tempering [an important stage in the chocolate-making <br>process], but also a far better mouthfeel to the chocolate… cocoa butter melts at body temperature, and this is <br>why we see it widely used in cosmetic products,” explains James.But this doesn’t mean that you can’t get <br>low-quality dark chocolate. Some commercial brands of dark chocolate contain low-quality cacao, high levels of <br>sugar, and additives. As Mackenzie explains, “bad” chocolate is made using inferior beans or cacaoa butter, or <br>with minimal cacao in the finished product.She also emphasizes the importance of cacao percentages. “While a <br>Hershey’s Kiss might contain 11% cacao, a specialty dark chocolate very likely has a lot more cacao – as much as <br>100% – because cocoa butter is part of the cocoa bean. The amount of cocoa butter used is included in the <br>percentage of cacao in the chocolate.”Mackenzie says that the primary differences among chocolates are sweetness, <br>mouthfeel, and how (or not) the cacao is highlighted
