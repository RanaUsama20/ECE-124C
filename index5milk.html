           <p class="chh">Milk chocolate is made in a similar way to dark chocolate, but with the addition of dried milk. <br>Mackenzie explains that the combination of the dairy, cacao butter, and sugar is responsible for making milk <br>chocolate bars sweet and creamy.These ingredients also balance out, or homogenize, the individual flavors of <br>different beans. Just like in specialty coffee, blends are more likely to be consumed with milk (in coffee, this is<br> in the form of espresso-based drinks).“The addition of milk powder smooths out cacao flavor. The primary reason <br>milk chocolate came to be the flavor many people call chocolate is because blends of beans were used,” Mackenzie <br>says.Milk chocolate usually has a smaller percentage of cacao solids than dark chocolate and a higher percentage <br>of cocoa butter and sugar. “In specialty chocolate, milk chocolates range from 45% [cacao] to dark milk<br> chocolates, which are 60–68%,” Mackenzie tells me.Commercial milk chocolate tends to have a much lower number of<br> solids. Cadbury’s Bournville dark chocolate has a minimum of 36% cacao content, and its Dairy Milk bar is at 26%.<br>
