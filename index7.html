           	<h1><i>About chocolate</i></h1>
       <p>Chocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec<br> archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate's preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as<br> 1750 BC.[7] On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cacao beverages<br>  dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.[8][7] The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial <br> use of cacao was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cacao beans was likely used as a source of <br> fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.[9]An early Classic-period (460–480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site in Rio Azul had <br> vessels with the Maya glyph for cacao on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking<br>  chocolate around 400 AD.[10] Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition<br>  to everyday life.[11] The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards,[12] and used the cacao seeds the trees produced to <br> make a frothy, bitter drink.[13]Until the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the <br> Central American peoples.[14] Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cacao bean on Columbus's fourth <br> mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cacao <br> beans among other goods for trade.[20] Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés may have been the first European to encounter<br>  it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma.[10][21] Jose de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit <br> missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the <br> Spaniards:Loathsome to such as are not acquainted with it, having a scum or froth that is very unpleasant to taste. Yet it <br> is a drink very much esteemed among the Indians, where with they feast noble men who pass through their country. The <br> Spaniards, both men and women, that are accustomed to the country, are very greedy of this Chocolaté. They say they make <br> diverse sorts of it, some hot, some cold, and some temperate, and put therein much of that 'chili'; yea, they make<br>  paste thereof, the which they say is good for the stomach and against the catarrh.[22]<br> </p>
