	White chocolate may be the opposite of dark chocolate in color, but not in ingredients. Like its <br>darker siblings, white chocolate is made using cacao. But the main ingredient here is cacao butter, rather than <br>solids.Although it has long been regarded as for children and those who don’t like “real” chocolate, white <br>chocolate can be more nuanced than you may think.James explains white chocolate’s reputation. “Although made from <br>cocoa butter, which is approximately 50% of the cocoa bean, it tends to have more milk powders, refined sugars, <br>and flavorings. But we tend to keep to a minimum of 35–40% cocoa butter in our white chocolate range,” he <br>says.He acknowledges that white chocolate has a “somewhat bad press among the general public” but says that craft <br>chocolate makers are making changes. They are reducing the use of milk powder and flavorings while adding more <br>cacaoa butter and unrefined sugars to white chocolate recipes. “Some of us are looking to replace sugars with <br>fruit powders,” he says.Although some people dismiss white chocolate as one-dimensional and overly sweet, James <br>says that there are some sophisticated options. “There are some specialist chocolate bars in this category, known <br>as ‘toasted white’ or ‘blonde’ chocolate. This particular variety of chocolate brings out biscuity and natural<br> caramel flavor notes.”
