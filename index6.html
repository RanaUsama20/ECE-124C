           <p class="chh">Ruby chocolate is a variety of chocolate introduced in 2017 by Barry Callebaut, a Belgianâ€“Swiss <br>cocoa company. The variety has been in development since 2004 and in 2015, the product was patented by Dumarche <br>et al. credited as inventors and Barry Callebaut as assignee under patent number US 9107430, 2015. It was unveiled<br> at a private event in Shanghai on 5 September, 2017. It is marketed as the "fourth" type of <br>chocolate alongside dark, milk, and white chocolate varieties and is notable for its natural pink colour.<br>
           The chocolate is characterized by a taste that has been described as slightly sweet and sour, which is comparable <br>to that of berries, as the chocolate's main characteristic is its acidity. In a comparison of the phenolic<br> content between varieties of chocolate, ruby chocolate was rated between milk and white chocolate. According to <br> standards set by the Food and Drug Administration, ruby chocolate must contain a minimum of 1.5% nonfat cacao <br>solids and a minimum of 20% by weight of cacao fat. It may contain antioxidants, spices, and other natural and <br>artificial flavorings, however, these ingredients cannot mimic the flavours of chocolate, milk, butter, or a <br>fruit, and it cannot contain additional colouring.
